# Surfs_Up
## Overview
I want to relocate to Oahu and came up with a really great idea of opening up a surf and ice cream shop (while living my dream). In order to do so, I need investors and met with W. Avy, who has experience with this type of business model. We worked on the data for Hawaii and I put together some visuals to back up the data. We looked at the tempertures (highs and lows), the precipitation, and the stations that report this data. This helps us understand better as to whether or not the Surf Shop/Ice Cream Shop will be successful or not.
## Results
We looked at data for the months of June and December to figure out if a Surf/Ice Cream shop would be sustainable year round.
* June Temperatures
* * Average temperature is 75 degrees.
* * Average precipitation is 0.14.
* * Maximum temperature is 85 degrees.
* * Max precipitation is 4.43.
* * Minimum temperature is 64 degrees with a precipitation of 0.

* December Temperatures
* * Average temperature is 71 degrees.
* * Average precipitation is 0.22.
* * Maximum temperature is 83 degrees.
* * Maximum precipitation is 6.42.
* * Minimum temperature is 56 degrees with a precipitation of 0.

## Summary
Based on the analysis performed, it looks like a Surf Shop/Ice Cream shop would work. There will be a chance of rain, as with any island, but for the most part, temperatures are steady and warm. An additional query I would like to run is during hurricane season. It would be interesting to know how the temperatures drop, or the increase of precipitation during hurricane season as the islands of Hawaii are prone to hurricanes. My second additional query I would run would be based on lava flow. I would be interested in the data regarding the spontaneous lava flow that occurs since Hawaii is on active volcanos.
